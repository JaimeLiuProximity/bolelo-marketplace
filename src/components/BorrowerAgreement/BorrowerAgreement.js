                The Borrower shall inspect each item of Item delivered pursuant to this Lease. The Borrower
                shall immediately notify the Lender of any discrepancies between such item of Item and the
                description of the Item in the Item Schedule. If the Borrower fails to provide such notice
                before accepting delivery of the Item, the Borrower will be conclusively presumed to have
                accepted the item as specified in the Item Schedule.

                The Borrower assumes all risks of loss or damage to the Item from any cause and agrees to return it
                to the Lender in the condition received from the Lender, with the exception of normal wear and tear,
                unless otherwise provided in this Lease.

                Unless otherwise provided in this Lease, if the item is damaged or lost, the Lender shall have the
                option of requiring the Borrower to repair the Item to a state of good working order, or replace
                the Item with like Item in good repair, which Item shall become the property of the Lender and
                subject to this Lease.

                Liability for injury, disability, and death of workers and other persons caused by operating,
                handling, or transporting the Item during the term of this Lease is the obligation of the Borrower,

                from and against all such liability.

                All notices required or permitted under this Lease shall be deemed delivered when delivered in person or

                The Borrower shall not assign or sublet any interest in this Lease or the Item or permit the Item to be

                If any portion of this Lease shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason,
                the remaining provisions shall continue to be valid and enforceable. If a court finds that
                any provision of this Lease is invalid or unenforceable, but that by limiting such provision,
                it would become valid and enforceable, then such provision shall be deemed to be written, construed,
                and enforced as so limited.
            </p>
            <p>
                The failure of either party to enforce any provision of this Lease shall not be construed as a waiver or limitation
                of that party's right to subsequently enforce and compel strict compliance with every provision of this Lease.
